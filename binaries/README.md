## Basic usage
The Evilserv is tested on Windows 7. Maybe in the future i'll test it on Windows 10 too.<br>
Remeber to put exe and dll in the same folder. <br>
By default the daemon start on port 666 but you can on your own port the command ```evilserv.exe <port>```<br>
The server contain two function ```SUPERSECUREFUNC``` used in the talk for the practice part and ```SUPERSECUREFUNC2``` that need a 
higher level of knowledge to be exploited.

### Disclaimer
This daemon is vulnerable by default so don't use it in a production environment, you choose to run it at your own risk

#### Credits
Evilserv is based on the Vulnserver by Stephen Bradshaw.<br>
